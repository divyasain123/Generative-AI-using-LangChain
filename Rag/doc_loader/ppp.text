Various radio stations are today competing to play the most popular songs in the market by different artists. Although these radio stations normally enter into a deal with the artists, who gets paid based on the number of times that music fans request their songs to be played on air for example, the fact that there are many good artists today clamouring to have their songs played on air, means that artists have to seek for additional avenues to make money (Kiley, 2008 p. 3). Radio stations are also very selective when it comes to the genre of music that they play. Therefore, it means that an artist can only have his/her songs played by a given radio station on the basis of the category of music that such a radio station plays. The issue of piracy in the music industry is also very rampant. Although there are various copyright societies that try to curb this vice, it is not in doubt that this has had a big blow on artists, by way of crushing their morale. It is not a wonder therefore that a majority of the current and upcoming artists in the music industry are now more inclined on clamouring to feature in advertising deals that will offer support to the money they make through record label
